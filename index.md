# Why do you need document verification?
Verification of official documents is one of the biggest problems of modern life. People are wasting their time when they need to verify documents physically which makes them getting stressed. Besides, they cause waste of paper which is a big issue to fight against global warming. In our country, if you take notaries as an example, time and labor force factors are not enough for the verification of huge number of documents at a time. When we consider how busy our daily lives are, such a system which provides its users to use their time efficiently while making sure that it’s safe, can make life easier. A notary system with these requirements must be smart, secure and easy to use; so that users do not get stressed about finding a notary, should not be limited about notary’s working hours and will be able to reduce the risk of human factor in terms of reliability.
